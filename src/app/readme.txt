Task 1: Implement a User Authentication System
Your task is to build a user authentication system using Angular, which should have the following features:
1. A login page that allows users to enter their email address and password.
2. A registration page that allows new users to sign up by providing their name, email address, and password.
3. A home page that displays a welcome message and some content only visible to authenticated users.
4. A navigation bar that shows different links based on the user's authentication status.
To implement this system, you should use the following:
5. Angular's built-in router to navigate between different pages and display the appropriate content based on the user's authentication status.
6. Angular's HttpClient to communicate with a backend API that stores user information and handles authentication and authorization.
7. Angular's Reactive Forms to create and validate the login and registration forms.
8. Angular's Route Guards to protect the home page and the user's profile page from unauthorized access.
